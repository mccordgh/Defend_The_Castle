* [Defend the Castle](https://mccordgh.github.io/Defend_The_Castle) is a video game with a twist on the classic [tower defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense) genre.
* The engine and game are written from scratch in JavaScript, and it runs right in your browser.

## How To Play

## Running it locally

To get it up and running locally, you'll need to have a local http-server. I use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)

Once you have http-server installed then:

* Clone this repo.

* From the root directory of it, run: $ http-server
In your browser, open: http://localhost:8080 and
http-server will automatically load the index.html from that directory.
* Leave http-server running, and whenever you change the code, you can do a hard refresh to run the newly saved code.

## Getting involved

Feel free to download this code, play with it, and add to the game, etc!
